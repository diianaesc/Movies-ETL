# Movies-ETL Analysis

Amazing Prime wants to develop an algorithm to predict which low budget movies being release will become popular so they can buy the streaming rights. 
First, using the ETL process we will extract the data from Wikipedia for all movies released since 1990 and the rating data from the Movie Land's website. Then, we will tranform it into one clean dataset and finally load the dataset into a SQL table

In this challenge to help Amazing Price predict the popular movies we will create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs transformations and loads daily data into the exisiting tables.
